            <p class="team-quote">“Bitcoin is My Lifeboat in Uncertain Waters“</p>
            <p>Faizal Abdillah professional journey began in the banking sector, where he gained firsthand insight into traditional finance. The discovery of Bitcoin—a technology with the potential to render banks obsolete—sparked a deep curiosity. As he delved further, he came to believe that many societal issues stem from flaws in our monetary systems, and that Bitcoin might offer a foundational solution. To him, holding Bitcoin is like sitting in a lifeboat beside the Titanic: if the financial system stays afloat, he journeys on; but if it sinks, he survives.</p>
