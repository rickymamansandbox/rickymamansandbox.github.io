Ricky Saif has been educating corporations since 2013. Today, he focuses on exposing the Fiat Flood crisis — where inflation quietly drains cash reserves while traditional assets underperform. He empowers pragmatic leaders to adopt bitcoin treasuries as an inflation-resistant solution. Ricky works exclusively with executives who understand the urgency of protecting their balance sheets and payrolls from monetary debasement.
